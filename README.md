# Clappy Mic

I struggle when looking for the clap emoji.

This little toy will send a clap 👏 for you when you clap!

## Setup

Install dependencies:

    $ yarn

Start it up:

    $ yarn run start

The app will then automatically start a floating window. Press the button and
start clapping!

## Compatibility

Currently tested and working on:
